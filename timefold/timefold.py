    """
    Cross-validation methods for timeseries data.

    Available methods
        * nested
            Generates train-test pair indices with a growing training window.

            Example (folds=3):
            TRAIN: [0 1 2] TEST: [3 4 5]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4 5] TEST: [6 7 8]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2s 3 4 5 6 7] TEST: [8 9]

        * window
            Generates train-test pair indices with a moving window.

            Example (folds=3):
            TRAIN: [0 1 2] TEST: [3 4 5]
            TRAIN: [3 4 5] TEST: [6 7 8]
            TRAIN: [6 7] TEST: [8 9]

        * step
            Generates one step ahead train-test pair indices with specified testing size.

            Fold argument is ignored. The maximum possible number of folds is generated based on
            the number of samples and specified testing window size.

            Example (test_size=1):
            TRAIN: [0] TEST: [1]
            TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2] TEST: [3]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3] TEST: [4]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4] TEST: [5]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4 5] TEST: [6]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6] TEST: [7]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7] TEST: [8]
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] TEST: [9]

        * shrink
            Generates train-test pair indices with a shrinking training window and constant testing window.

            Example (folds=3):
            TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7] TEST: [8 9]
            TRAIN: [3 4 5 6 7] TEST: [8 9]
            TRAIN: [6 7] TEST: [8 9]

        * stratified
            Generates stratified train-test pair indices where a ratio is preserved per fold.
